# Schema Definition

![](/images/schemadefination.jpg)



We need to define one or more recordtypes. Each recordType consists of fields and (optionally) validation rules.

 

**Left Pane Top – Schema Explorer**

Schema organized in an explorer-like fashion. On selecting each node, the views in the right grid are changed accordingly.

 

**Right**

This view displays recordtypes, fields or validation rules as per the node selected. Some cells may be editable or non-editable as per the context.

 

**Left Pane Bottom – Field Properties**

If a field is selected in the view grid, the left bottom pane displays the field properties. These depend on the data type and connection type in scope.
