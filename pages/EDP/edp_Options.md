|Option|Description|
|-------|------------|
|Default Location|Sets the directory where Easy Data Porter files are normally stored. This will help in easy selection later.|
|Path Substitution|When you select an input connection file or an output connection file, Easy Data Porter can apply path 
substitution relative to the map file location or the default location. This helps in locating field later when you move the 
files to a production environment or another location.|
|Company Name and Address|These are printed at the top of all printouts|
|Sync Ribbon Tab with Bottom Tab|When you select the tabs from the bottom portion (schema/connection/map), 
the ribbon tab will be automatically changed to present relevant commands|
