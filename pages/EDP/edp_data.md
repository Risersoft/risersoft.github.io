# Data

![](/images/data.jpg)

The internal data browser will show source/target data in Easy Data Porter. In case of a database, the tables/views will be listed on the left and you can select any one of them to list the contents.

 

If the source/target connection is file based, you can select the external browser command to launch the windows application associated with the filetype. For example, Microsoft Access for *.mdb, Notepad for *.txt and so on.
