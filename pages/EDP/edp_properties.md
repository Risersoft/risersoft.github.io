# Properties

![](/images/properties.jpg)

Some connectors like the Text Delimited define properties to customize behavior. These appear in the property grid and can be selected by user. These are saved along with connection information. Often, the properties will have a drop down button next to them allowing selection from a pre-defined list. Some properties will also allow a free text entry in addition to the drop down selection.
