# Documentation Notes

 

While every attempt has been made to keep the documentation up to date, there may be instances where the actual screens or output do not exactly match with what has been given here. This is generally due to ongoing continuous improvement in the product.

In any case, the documentation should be able to explain how to operate and what kind of output to expect.
