# Query Builder

![](/images/querydesigner.jpg)

This window allows you to graphically build you SQL statement.

 

If the provider supports schema information, a list of tables and views is displayed on the right. On the left is the list of objects currently used in the query.

 

The text SQL statement and the graphical window are kept in sync such that any change in one of them reflects in the other one.

 

You can choose the query result tab in the top portion to execute the query and examine results.
