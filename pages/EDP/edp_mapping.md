# Mapping

![](/images/mapping.jpg)

The Mapping tab allows user to write “mappings” from the source to target data. The left pane shows the source schema and the right pane shows the target schema along with a special column for “Map Expressions”.

 

If more than one recordtype have been defined in the schema, a selection can be made in the top portion and the bottom views will update to list the fields for the selected recordtype.

 

In addition to this, sample data is listed for source and target. The source sample data is fetched from the data source. The target sample data is computed using the map expression defined to give you a feel of how your transformed data will look like.

 

A record selector is available in the bottom portion to move between source records. The source and target sample data will be updated accordingly.
