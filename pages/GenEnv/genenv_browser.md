A browser is a pre-defined set of views with filters pre-applied. This is presented in the form of nodes in a tree in the left hand pane and a new view is generated when a node is selected.

To go to the pay period browser, select any pay period and right click and select “Browse pay period”

interface ready to be viewed and printed.
